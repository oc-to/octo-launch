Getting Started
===============

To begin your project, you first need to install the framework:  

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install octo-framework

Once installed, you can start a new project by running:  

.. code-block:: bash

   octo startproject "your_project_name"

The project structure is well-organized, with separate applications placed inside the `/app` directory.  
If you want to add a new application, ensure you are in the root of your project and run:  

.. code-block:: bash

   octo startapp "your_app_name"

This will create a new application following the same structure as the main project.
